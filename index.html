<p>My Name is Amin Gaffoor and I was born in Guyana. I moved to America when I was eight years old. I am a son of two hard working parents, who have always pushed me in my education or even just to be my best self. I have two older siblings that took care of me my whole life. I just graduated high school from Marble Hill and plan to attend Lehman college by majoring in  psychology. I am open to different careers and experiences that can benefit me and push me since I am still unsure on what I would like to do. Feel free to reach out to me by using any of my socials or even linkedln.
